# What is SchoolPad
A small device to pull a webcal feed, for example a class schedule, and display it. It is the perfect school companion.

# How does it work
When you boot up the device, it pulls the webcal feed from a file. This file is generated any time you click the B button, when it fetches the data and parses it. You should do this once a day to ensure up-to-date classes. It then displays the classes.

# How to use it
Once it is loaded, you will be presented with your first event. On there it will show the event name (first 1-2 lines), the start time, the end time, and how long until, or how much longer is left. Using the A/C buttons, you can navigate to the next or previous event. After five minutes, the device goes into light sleep, in which you can click A to wake it back up instantly. And 60 seconds later, the device enters deep sleep, which can be woken from with the A button, but will take a minute to load.
