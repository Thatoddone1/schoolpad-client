# What is SchoolPad
A small device to pull a webcal feed, for example a class schedule, and display it. It is the perfect school companion.

# How does it work
When you boot up the device, it pulls the webcal feed from a file. This file is generated any time you click the B button, when it fetches the data and parses it. You should do this once a day to ensure up-to-date classes. It then displays the classes.

# How to use it
Once it is loaded, you will be presented with your first event. On there it will show the event name (first 1-2 lines), the start time, the end time, and how long until, or how much longer is left. Using the A/C buttons, you can navigate to the next or previous event. After five minutes, the device goes into light sleep, in which you can click A to wake it back up instantly. And 60 seconds later, the device enters deep sleep, which can be woken from with the A button, but will take a minute to load.

# Why‚ÄΩ
Many schools of all ages, middle schools, high schools, and even colleges have been implementing phone collection policies, which can make it difficult to access schedules. Many of these schedules are already online, and change quite often. That's where SchoolPad comes in. It provides a quick, easy way to check your schedule from a feed online, which most school calendar services provide, and know when and where you are going. It can also be used for non-school/university applications, such as a general calendar tool. It is just a project I made for myself, and thought would be useful to share. I hope it is useful! üéâ
